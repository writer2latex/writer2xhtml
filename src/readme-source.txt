Overview
--------

The source of Writer2xhtml consists of three major parts:

* A general purpose java library for converting OpenDocument files into LaTeX,
  BibTeX, XHTML, XHTML+MathML, HTML5 and EPUB
  This is to be found in the packages writer2xhtml.* and should only be used
  through the provided api writer2xhtml.api.*
* A command line utility writer2xhtml.Application
* A collection of components for LibreOffice and Apache OpenOffice
  These are to be found in the packages org.openoffice.da.comp.*
  
Currently parts of the source for Writer2LaTeX are somewhat messy and
undocumented. This situation tends to improve over time :-)

Building Writer2LaTeX
---------------------

Writer2LaTeX uses Ant version 1.6 or later (http://ant.apache.org) to build.


Some java libraries from OOo are needed to build the filter part of Writer2LaTeX,
these are jurt.jar, unoil.jar, ridl.jar and juh.jar.

To make these files available for the compiler, edit the file build.xml
as follows:

The lines
	<property name="OFFICE_CLASSES" location="/usr/share/java" />
	<property name="URE_CLASSES" location="/usr/share/java" />
should be modified to the directories where your LO/AOO installation keeps these files
With some LO/AOO installations, you need to install the office development kit as well

The line
	<property name="JAVA6_RT_JAR" location="/home/hj/jre6/lib/rt.jar" />
should be modified to point to rt.jar from a java 6 runtime
(if you want to cross compile for java 6, otherwise change the parameters to the javac task) 

To build, open a command shell, navigate to the source directory and type

ant oxt

(this assumes, that ant is in your path; otherwise specifify the full path.)

In addition to oxt, the build file supports the following targets:
    all
        Build nearly everything
    compile
        Compile all file except the tests.        
    jar
        Create the standalone jar file.
    javadoc
        Create the javadoc documentation in target/javadoc.
    distro
	    Create distribution files 
    clean

Thanks to Michael Niedermair for writing the original ant build file
